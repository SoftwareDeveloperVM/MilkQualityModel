# MilkQualityModel
ML Model developed in Python using Keras, Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-Learn. Used Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab for the development process. In order to use the program run the file_main.py file, and then input the two numerical data points, the model will return the result and it's confidence. The first data point is the bacterial count of the milk, which measures in colony-forming units of bacteria per milliliter (CFUs/ml) at roughly 30 degrees celsius. And the second point is the somatic cell count (SCC) per milliliter of milk. Based on these data poihnts the model can provide a description of the milks safety for consumption. These regulations by which this model is trained, conforms to the United States of America Legal standards for Grade A Milk.

The value ranges for somatic cell count was sourced from an article written by Pennsylvania State University and University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
